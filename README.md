# Simple Maze Generation Library

Written by [Geoffrey Challen](http://bluegroup.systems/people/gwa) for [CS
125@Illinois](https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu). Based on [published maze
generation algorithms](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Maze_generation) and a
[parallel JavaScript
implementation](https://github.com/cs125-illinois/mazemaker.js). (Which is much
cleaner because it's JavaScript.)

This package is available on [`jitpack.io`](https://jitpack.io). Add the
following to your `build.gradle` file to add it to your project:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.cs125-illinois:mazemaker:0.3'
}
```
